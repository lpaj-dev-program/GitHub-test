<h2><p style="text-align: center;"> Expected the unexpected</p></h2>
<p><em>The word that usually describes me is "expected the unexpected." Prior to this, I didn't even believe I could complete high school, but I also believed that I had graduated with accomplishment. Even though I've accomplished these things, it feels great since I've accomplished something. This is the evidence that I have accumulated over the years.

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">Why BSIT course</p></h2>
<p><em>When I was in grade 6, we had a class that was all about PPT or power point, which was more focused on editing, and I found myself happy even when it was difficult to edit. When we went to school one day, we were offered a scholarship, but the award required us to study at a school that focused more on technology, so I tried everything. I passed, what prevent me to go for it is the school that the scholarship offer is far away from my home,so start then i knew that im into technology.</em></p>

<h2><p style="text-align: center;">College life</p></h2>
<p><em>Still in college, but in my second year..It was as if I thought I couldn't go to college.. Before I came to college, I was thinking of working first , but my cousin chose me if I wanted to study. Of course, I was a risk taker, and I risked, so here I am now having a difficult time at school and work, yes, I have work and studying at the same time  and hopefully my sacrifices will pay off someday.</em></p>
